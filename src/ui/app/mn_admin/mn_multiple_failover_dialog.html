          <strong>Data Loss Warning:</strong> For hard failover of multiple nodes,
          each Couchbase bucket must have at least as many replicas as the total
          number of nodes failed over or you WILL lose data. Since hard failover
          removes nodes immediately it may also result in failure of in-flight operations.

          <strong>Unsafe Failover Warning:</strong>
          Failover cannot be performed safely as a majority of servers in the cluster can't be reached.
          If you wish you may unsafely failover the unreachable nodes. If so, all nodes that survive
          the unsafe failover must be reachable. Additionally, nodes that have failed over unsafely
          will be immediately removed from the cluster. Administrators should ensure these nodes are
          properly shut down, reinitialized, and removed from any DNS records or load balancers, as applicable.
