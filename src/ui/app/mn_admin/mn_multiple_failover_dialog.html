          <strong>Data Loss Warning:</strong> For hard failover of multiple nodes,
          each Couchbase bucket must have at least as many replicas as the total
          number of nodes failed over or you WILL lose data. Since hard failover
          removes nodes immediately it may also result in failure of in-flight operations.

          <strong>Unsafe Failover Warning:</strong>
          Failover cannot be performed safely as a majority of servers in the cluster can't be reached.
          If you wish you may unsafely failover the unreachable nodes. If so, all nodes that survive
          the unsafe failover must be reachable. Additionally, unsafely failed over nodes will be
          immediately removed from the cluster and administrators should ensure they are brought
          down and reinitialized. See <a href="https://docs.couchbase.com/server/{{multipleFailoverDialogCtl.implementationVersion | mnMajorMinorVersion}}/learn/clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.html#performing-an-unsafe-failover" target="_blank">Performing an Unsafe Failover</a> in the Couchbase documentation. Do you wish to perform an unsafe failover?
